Now you have a comprehensive Tools Registry implementation with the following features:
What I've Built For You

Core Tools Registry System

Central registry for all tools (tools/registry.py)
Flexible tool execution and discovery
Error handling and result tracking


Extended Tool Categories

Git Tools for repository management
Web Tools for HTTP requests and web scraping
Database Tools for SQLite operations
Standard file and shell operations


Integrated UI Enhancements

Multi-tab interface with Tasks, Jobs, Files, Tools, and Settings
Direct tool testing interface
File browser and editor
Job management with detailed views and controls


Job System Integration

Tools work with the job manager to track execution
Results are stored in job history
Support for resuming and retrying operations



How To Use

Start Using the Tools Registry

Launch streamlit_ui.py to access the enhanced UI
Try the "Tools" tab to explore all available tools
Create tasks from the Tasks tab that will use tools automatically


Adding New Tools

Create a new module (like my_custom_tools.py)
Register your tools using the pattern in the existing modules
Update tools/__init__.py to include your new tools


Customizing Tool Execution

The TaskPlanner now supports advanced tool execution
LLM can generate execution plans with specific tool calls
The execution engine can handle complex multi-step operations



Next Steps
Consider these future enhancements:

Add Authentication for Tools

Support for API keys and credentials
Secure storage of sensitive information


Create More Specialized Tools

Add AI/ML tools for model inference
Add visualization tools for data processing
Add deployment tools for cloud services


Implement Tool Pipelines

Define sequences of tools that work together
Create reusable workflows for common tasks


Add Unit Tests

Create tests for each tool to ensure reliability
Set up automated testing for the registry



Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?

It looks like there's an indentation error in the updated Streamlit UI file. Let's fix that first and then I'll suggest some tests you can run to verify that the Tools Registry is working correctly.

## First, let's fix the indentation error:



## End-to-End Tests You Can Run

Now that we've fixed the indentation error, here are some useful end-to-end tests you can run to verify that your Tools Registry implementation is working correctly:

### Test 1: Basic File Operations
This test verifies that the registry can handle file operations using the tools interface.

1. Go to the "Tools" tab in the Streamlit UI
2. Select the "write_file" tool
3. Set the path to "workspace/test_file.txt"
4. Enter some test content like "This is a test file created by the tools registry"
5. Click "Run Tool"
6. Then select the "read_file" tool
7. Set the path to "workspace/test_file.txt"
8. Click "Run Tool" and verify you can read back the content

### Test 2: Execute Python Code
This test verifies that the code execution tool works correctly.

1. Go to the "Tools" tab
2. Select the "run_code" tool
3. Enter a Python script like:
   ```python
   import os

   print("Current directory contents:")
   for item in os.listdir():
       print(f"- {item}")

   print("\nPython version info:")
   import sys
   print(sys.version)
   ```
4. Click "Run Tool" and verify the output shows directory contents and Python version

### Test 3: Shell Command Execution
This test verifies that the shell command execution works.

1. Go to the "Tools" tab
2. Select the "run_shell" tool
3. Enter a command like `ls -la` (or `dir` on Windows)
4. Click "Run Tool" and verify you see directory listing output

### Test 4: Web Tools Test
This test verifies that web tools can fetch external content.

1. Go to the "Tools" tab
2. Select the "fetch_url" tool
3. Enter a URL like "https://httpbin.org/get"
4. Click "Run Tool" and verify you receive a JSON response

### Test 5: Database Integration
This test verifies that database tools work correctly.

1. Go to the "Tools" tab
2. Select the "create_database" tool
3. Set the path to "workspace/test.db"
4. Click "Run Tool"
5. Then select the "execute_query" tool
6. Set the database path to "workspace/test.db"
7. Enter a query like "CREATE TABLE test (id INTEGER, name TEXT)"
8. Click "Run Tool"
9. Execute another query: "INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 'Test Item')"
10. Finally, query the data: "SELECT * FROM test"

### Test 6: Task Automation Test
This is a comprehensive test using the main task interface:

1. Go to the "Tasks" tab
2. Enter a task like: "Create a Python script that lists all files in the workspace directory, sorts them by size, and saves the result to a JSON file"
3. Submit the task and observe how the system:
   - Plans the task
   - Uses file_ops tools for writing/reading files
   - Uses run_code for executing Python
   - Tracks job progress

### Test 7: Git Integration Test
This test verifies that git tools work in your local repository:

1. Go to the "Tools" tab
2. Select the "git_status" tool
3. Click "Run Tool" to see the status of your local repository
4. Try other git tools like "git_log" and "git_diff"

### Test 8: Job Management Test
This test verifies that the job management system works with tools:

1. Create a task that will fail (e.g., "Create a Python script that connects to a non-existent database")
2. Let it fail at some step
3. Go to the "Jobs" tab
4. Find your job and click "Retry Step X" on the failed step
5. Verify that the step is retried and the job continues

These tests cover most of the functionality of your Tools Registry integration. They'll help you verify that all components are working together properly, from the registry itself to the UI integration and job management system.

Once you've run these tests and confirmed everything works as expected, we can proceed to the next steps in enhancing your LocalGenius system.
