Absolutely Mahesh — here's your polished, copy-paste–ready `README.md` in clean Markdown for `localgenius`. It's concise, beginner-friendly, and reflects exactly what you've built:

---

```markdown
# 🧠 LocalGenius

**LocalGenius** is a local-first, privacy-preserving dev agent powered by [LLaMA 3](https://ollama.com/library/llama3) and [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/). It breaks down tasks, executes them, stores memory, and runs entirely on your machine — CLI or UI.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone and setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/localgenius.git
cd localgenius
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Ollama and make sure the model is available

```bash
ollama run llama3
```

> This will pull the LLaMA 3 model if you don’t have it already.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Run the Agent

### Run via CLI

```bash
python llama_dev_agent.py
```

### Run via Web UI

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
```

> Opens at: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
